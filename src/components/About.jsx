      <p className="text-xl mt-20">I'm looking for front-end or back-end developer roles and is an immediate joiner. I've been working as a Software Engineer at DCKAP Technologies right after my college. Have been trained on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, mongoDB and mongoose. Have developed website frontend code using the figma mockup designs and added functionalities. Also have been assisting server side running of a product developing for an e-commerce distributor in US.

        I completed my B-Tech in Production Engineering from Government Engineering College, Thrissur, Kerala in 2022. After my college I joined DCKAP through placement. Recently I have completed a Software Testing course and I'm skilled to do automation testing in Java and Selenium too.

        I am looking for a working environment where I can utilize my full potential, learn, unlearn, strengthen my core skills, and acquire leadership roles.
